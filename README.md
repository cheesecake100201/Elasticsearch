This repo contains queries for 2 Datasets. Using these queries we explore the database throughout. These datasets are present in ElasticSearch. Be mindful, that most of the queries have the same execution statements, so to avoid redundancy they haven't been mentioned in the code files since they follow a same template
This repo contains a config.ini file which is used to connect elasticsearch with the local python. The config.ini file contains username and password from a trial elasticsearch account made. To make sure it works for you, replace the current username and password with the once you receive.
